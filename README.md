# Covid-19-visualisation
## Introduction
The short report contained in this repository is an exploration of Covid-19 data intended for practice in data visualisation. Using visual comparisons of the UK and the UAE, I have light-heartedly explored the possibility for evidence of moral hazard in the dataset. 

Naturally, such a thing is, in reality, incredibly difficult to un-pick from the data. Nonetheless, I found it quite fun to speculate on the topic.

### Data
The data that I used for this report can be found [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).
